My website is a newsletter inspired by modern architecture. particularly in minimalist architecture.
The website was build on 4 different themes revolving around bauhaus, brutalism, deconstructivism and contemporary.
<br><br>

Inspiration:
The inspiration of the website is on modern and minimalist architecture, which holds resemblence to concrete looking structures. 
Inspired by the various art forms by different architects, I decided to put together and differentiate the different building styles for those with an untrained eye.
As I enjoyed the aesthetic of brutalism architecture and love the minimalistic websites, I decided to create one with inspiration with the avant-garde design in mind.
<br><br>

Accesibility:
As the website is created to be minimaistic, it is kept to ensure that it is accessible to the blind.
The sign up page for the newsletter is kept such that the blind will be able to detect points at which they have to key in inputs.
Each page is created with a brief and simple description of the different architectural styles. With example images and description of such designs to further the understanding of the reader.
Accompanied with a short and brief visual display of the theme, it is made for a better understanding of the style when reading up on the different buildings.
<br><br>

Usability:
As explained, the site is created to be minimal. Each page has only a few buttons to browse through, which is convenient and less confusing to the visually handicapped.
The features in each page (apart from the sign up page) requires the user to scroll to show the animations. As such, it is very usable for first time users. 
With a concrete background and black text, it is easily readable for users as well.
The website is also  made to be responsive for mobile. 
<br><br>

Learning: 
I had to get in depth with the different architectural styles and had to a fair bit of research to understand the different buildings before listing them on the site.
For the different pages which embodies the different styles, I had to find a link between the style for the theme, and had to find various css and javascript which are compatible to the page's theme.
In deconstructivism, the idea of a video being played when the user scrolls was inspired from the apple airpods scrolling feature. Although I had to research on how it is done, recreating the same feature took awhile for me.
Having to read each code written by different users, I found ways in combining both codes so that it will work with how i wanted it to be.
<br><br>

Evaluation I:
I believe that the construction of deconstructivism was particularly successful. I managed to make a scrolling feature that was similar to that of apple's airpods scrolling feature.
The representation of the the crushed paper was also a representation of deconstructivism and it was a great add on to the page.
Overall, I believe that the website holds its each representation of modern architectural style well and it would be educational for readers.
<br><br>

Evaluation II:What aspects of your work could be improved? How might you do things differently another time?
I believe that some webpages could have more javascript implemented to it. More javascript implementation that contains more bite sized information would make it more interesting and more educational.
If i could do it differently, I would have changed the grid layouts so that they are all not so similar, this time with more javascript that could be more in line with the theme of the webpages.
